* Running git init is idempotent.  The real behaviour is not idempotent, but it is as far as the features of gimlet are concerned: https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-init.html
* no description file
* only well-formed -w like command-line flags, and each one separate: -w -b, and no data for any args
* hash function as simple as possible for brevity - real git uses sha1
* prob no packfiles
* prob no support for wildcard paths in git add
* do not support --remove for update-index so no mention of it when trying to update-index w non existent path
* assume all things inside repos are dirs or files
* artificially lock refs creation to HEAD and refs/heads/[whatever] - otherwise have to protect other files and deal with different messages for eg overwriting dirs vs trying to overwrite files like index that git relies on
* do not support hash abreviations

todo
* cd back to repo root for all commands
* support update-ref for HEAD (will need to change update-ref code so that ref1 is rerefed to branch ref) (will need to mention )
* sort out which unexpected results to throw for and which to just print for: error, fatal, or just message (eg commit when nothing to commit)
* support detached head
