* Running git init is idempotent.  The real behaviour is not idempotent, but it is as far as the features of gimlet are concerned: https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-init.html
* no description file
* only well-formed -w like command-line flags, and each one separate: -w -b, and no data for any args
* hash function as simple as possible for brevity - real git uses sha1

todo
* cd back to repo root for all commands
