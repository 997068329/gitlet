# Gitlet

Git implemented in JavaScript.

Supports `init`, `add`, `rm`, `commit`, `branch`, `checkout`, `diff`, `remote`, `fetch`, `merge`, `pull` and `clone`.  To do: `push`.

I wrote Gitlet to demonstrate how Git works under the covers.  The code is about 1200 lines.  It's written to be readable.  It's not written to be fast or feature complete.

If you want to read the source, start here: [gitlet.js](src/gitlet.js).
