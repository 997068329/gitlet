# Gitlet

Supported commands: `init`, `add`, `rm`, `commit`, `branch`, `checkout`, `diff`, `remote`, `fetch` and `merge`.  To do: `push`, `pull`.

Gitlet is a toy that demonstrates how Git works under the covers.  The code is about 1000 lines.  It's written to be readable.  It's not written to be fast or feature complete.

If you're reading the source, start at the main API file: [gitlet.js](src/gitlet.js).
