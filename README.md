# Gitlet

Git implemented in JavaScript.

Supports `init`, `add`, `rm`, `commit`, `branch`, `checkout`, `diff`, `remote`, `fetch`, `merge`, `push`, `pull`, `status` and `clone`.

I wrote Gitlet to demonstrate how Git works under the covers.  The code is about 1300 lines.  It's written to be readable.  It's not written to be fast or feature complete.

1200 lines of code sounds intimidating.  But, because the code mirrors the terminology of the Git command line interface, it should be approachable.  Further, the implementation of the main Git commands is only 350 lines: [gitlet.js](src/gitlet.js).
